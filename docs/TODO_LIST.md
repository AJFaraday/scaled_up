# TODO list!

This is a reference for things which have not yet been developed for Scaled Up^. They may, or may not, be added to the app in future.

If you are reading this and you are not Andrew Faraday, items on this list could be your contribution to Scaled Up^

* Sequence events: Users select X notes and they are played back in this order.
* Some kind of sequence where the user input is a change to one step in the event. 
* Length options: Should be specific to each Order Profile
* Length UI: Should be a clickable picture of the note value
* A "conductor" page, only accessible to localhost, which allows the user to activate or deactivate event profiles.
* UI to modify event profiles, note options, build sample groups etc.
* UI to show queued events.
* UI to show the sequence which has been played (not sure about this)
* General styling improvement, make it look like an app instead of a word document.
* Implement System Settings from config/system_setings.yml
* Translations for all user-facing attributes, particularly source, which is meaningless and event profile, which I could use a better name for.
* More than one option for pure data patches, "audio skinning"
* Some form of stats on events, which notes/samples are chosen, who makes the most input. 
* Write some unit tests - yawn
* Write controller tests - yawn
* Write feature tests - eek
